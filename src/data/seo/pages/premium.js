      title: 'Responsible Betting Guidelines',
      content: `<p>Successful sports betting requires a responsible approach. Here are important principles to follow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bet only what you can afford to lose</strong> - Never use money needed for essential expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Start with lower stakes</strong> - Begin with small bets (1-2% of your total betting budget per multibet).</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid chasing losses</strong> - Accept that some bets will lose and resist the urge to immediately recover losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Take regular breaks</strong> - Don't bet every day; schedule days when you don't place any bets.</li>
        <li><strong>Betting is not income</strong> - View betting as entertainment rather than a source of income.</li>
      </ul>`

    {
      question: 'How are premium multibet tips different from regular predictions?',
      answer: `<p>Premium multibet tips undergo a more rigorous selection process by our analysts, focusing on value opportunities and balanced risk. They combine multiple selections to create higher potential returns and are typically our most confident predictions.</p>`
    },
    {
      question: 'What stake size should I use for multibet slips?',
      answer: `<p>We recommend starting with small stakes, typically 1-2% of your total betting budget per multibet. As multibets combine multiple selections, they carry higher risk despite the potential for bigger returns. Beginning conservatively allows you to learn and adjust your strategy while minimizing potential losses.</p>`
    },
    {
      question: 'How often are premium tips updated?',
      answer: `<p>Our premium multibet tips are updated daily, with special focus on major matchdays and weekends when more high-quality fixtures are available. We prioritize quality over quantity, so some days may have fewer selections if our analysis doesn't identify strong opportunities.</p>`
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the success rate of premium multibet tips?',
      answer: `<p>While individual multibets have a lower hit rate than single bets by nature (as all selections must win), our premium multibets are designed to provide positive expected value over time. Success rates vary based on the number of selections, but our focus is on long-term profitability rather than win percentage.</p>`
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I combine selections from different premium slips?',
      answer: `<p>While you can certainly create your own combinations, we recommend following our premium slips as designed initially. Our analysis considers how selections work together, including correlation between outcomes. If you do create custom combinations, maintain the same responsible staking principles.</p>`
