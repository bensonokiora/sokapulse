      <ol>
        <li><strong>Probability Calculation:</strong> We calculate the real chances of each possible outcome</li>

        <li><strong>Expert Verification:</strong> Our team checks that statistics align with current team situations</li>
        <li><strong>Staking Advice:</strong> We recommend appropriate bet sizes based on the edge size</li>

      <p>This careful approach consistently finds opportunities where bookmakers have mispriced the odds, giving you a mathematical advantage that pays off over time. While any single prediction might not win, this smart approach to value betting has proven profitable over the long term when following a disciplined staking plan.</p>`
