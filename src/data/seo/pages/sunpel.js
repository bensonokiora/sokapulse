      <h4>Match Outcome Predictions That Actually Work</h4>
      <p>We don't just guess who's going to win. Our system digs into over 200 team-specific data points, looks at head-to-head history, evaluates current squad strength, and examines form indicators from multiple angles. We pay special attention to how teams perform at home versus away, their tactical approaches, and other key variables to give you predictions you can trust.</p>
      
      <h4>Score Predictions That Make Sense</h4>
      <p>Getting the exact score right isn't easy, but our custom mathematical models and team performance analysis give you the best shot. We look at attacking efficiency, defensive strength, and historical scoring patterns. We even factor in things many overlook – like weather conditions, team formations, and even referee tendencies – to improve our accuracy.</p>
      
      <h4>Goal Predictions You Can Rely On</h4>
      <p>Our specialized goals prediction system looks at team scoring tendencies, defensive vulnerabilities, and historical goal patterns to nail those over/under predictions and both-teams-to-score forecasts.
